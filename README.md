# hello-world
An initial repository to store ideas, resources, and perhaps even share/discuss with others at some point.

Hey people.

This is it, the first step in a journey - how long the journey is, we shall see...
The reason I am here is due to having some ideas, and then the curiosity to see if I can code my own website.

A certain money hungry and not particularly helpful company (surely not, they exist?!) that acts as a host site for people to rent out their property is not the only reason for my interest, but it does provide some purpose.

Then a course for HTML, CSS, and Javascript came up after a search on Coursera. That course led me here.

So, let's get started!
